**GMIT (Give me ideas to travel)**

The purpose of GMIT is to allow people to find places to travel when they don't know where to visit on their next trip. 

why we choose a daruma doll as our icon, the daruma doll is a symbol of happiness that people tend to buy so they can have their wish fulfilled we want users / clients to find a place they would like to visit to be happy or have their wish fulfilled.

the functionality of GMIT is a very simple and easy concept to understand clients / users can either like or dislike the places we show them, if a user dislikes a place we simply just show another place or city we think they might like, if a user likes a certain place such as a city we show places in that city that they may like or dislike at this stage when the user likes a place it will be saved/stored for them which they can then access.

we also have a bookmark feature that will allow users to bookmark certain city so if they wanted to jump back and search for places in that city again they can feel free to do so.

we also have a subscription page which will allow users to choose the plan they want, each plan have their very own unique perks.

starting from the basic daruma plan (basic)

- Ability to bookmark (limited to 5)
- Ability to Like/save places (limited at 5)
- Users can leave review 

The daruma arcade rainbow plan aka the daruma plus

- Increased bookmark storage (limit increased by 10) Can store up to 15 things
- Increased Like/save places (limit increased by 10) Can store up to 15 things
- keeps every feature the previous plan had

The daruma Classic Gold

- Increased bookmark storage (limit increased by 15) Can store up to 30 things
- Increased Like/save places (limit increased by 15) Can store up to 30 things
- Border around profile is gold!!! and can be seen by other people also when leaving a review people will see a golden border around you.
- also receives a golden badge!! that is kept permanently even after subscription runs out.
- keeps every feature the previous plan had



<u>**Tech stack**</u>

- JavaScript / cypress
- bootstrap
- Ruby & Ruby on rails
- HTML5 & CSS3





TIME LINE 
Day 1 - discussed what the project was gonna be about (22 of march)

day 2 - we created Wireframe on balsamiq and erd using DB Designer and also saved our ERD (23 of march)

day 3 - we started the rails project we added our gems such simple-form, devise , bootstrap and also added cypress for testing.

day 4 - team members worked on their spesific feature the features that were being worked on were profiles, navbar and the main functionality which was a very hard job.

day 5 - 2 members worked on the main functionality to finish this before the deadline while other members gathered photographs and collected images for the presentation.

<u>Not noted in the timeline</u>

Time line was done at the end of everyday testing were done at the very end of each feature.






















































































































Q1- What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

    In this project, we will be aiming at travellers who are being introduced to new countries/cities and they dont know the attraction sites or best places to eat (because come on, who doesn't love a good feed?). we will also be helping out couples who are looking for date ideas, or individuals planning family trips. in addittion to helping out businesses who are looking forward to expand their profit margin by having them included in our app for people to visit.

Q2- Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

    This app will be aiming at people who are bored and tired of searching up new places to visit by limiting their searches to one screen. it will assist them in exploting new restaurants to eat, or find new adventures and experiences that they havn't had before! This problem needs solving because most of the future generations end up canceling their outings due to them not being able to plan or their lack of ability in searching places which end up causing a mental impact on them. 

Q3- Describe the project will you be conducting and how. your App will address the needs.


Q4- Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.

    The app will be based on the infastructure of tinder, where the user will be swiping left to dislike(skip) or right to like(save) the attraction. the app will be a bit different from tinder in the sense where the attraction will save straight away after liking and there is no one on the other side that will be swiping on your profile. 

Q5- Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

    the softwares that we used while developing the app were; dbdesigner to assist us in designing the back-end side of the app where it visualised the links between the tables, balsamiq which we used to create a sketch the front-end design of how the website should look like throughout the differernt pages on both platforms(phone and computer). We also used cypress in order to automatically test that our app is working, then heroku to deploy it and make it go live,we used github and their branches feature to be able to each do our part without breaking eachothers code, and slack was used for communication.

Q6- Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.

    The database that we decided to use was PostgreSQL, because of its object-relational ability which gave it an advantage over other open sourse SQL databases. Biggest advantage for object-relational date bases is the aid they give to users in defining objects and their behavior, which makes PostgreSQL very adaptable. It also allows the user to create complicated data designs, store and review them.
    !!ADD CONS!!

Q7- Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).
