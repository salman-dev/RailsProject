Salmans part:
find 5-10 attractions in:
    1-syndey
    2-lebanon
    3-cambodia
    4-tokyo


Q1- What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

    In this project, we will be aiming at travellers who are being introduced to new countries/cities and they dont know the attraction sites or best places to eat (because come on, who doesn't love a good feed?). we will also be helping out couples who are looking for date ideas, or individuals planning family trips. in addittion to helping out businesses who are looking forward to expand their profit margin by having them included in our app for people to visit.

Q2- Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

    This app will be aiming at people who are bored and tired of searching up new places to visit by limiting their searches to one screen. it will assist them in exploting new restaurants to eat, or find new adventures and experiences that they havn't had before! This problem needs solving because most of the future generations end up canceling their outings due to them not being able to plan or their lack of ability in searching places which end up causing a mental impact on them.
