**GMIT (Give me ideas to travel)**

The purpose of GMIT is to allow people to find places to travel when they don't know where to visit on their next trip. 

why we choose a daruma doll as our icon, the daruma doll is a symbol of happiness that people tend to buy so they can have their wish fulfilled we want users / clients to find a place they would like to visit to be happy or have their wish fulfilled.

the functionality of GMIT is a very simple and easy concept to understand clients / users can either like or dislike the places we show them, if a user dislikes a place we simply just show another place or city we think they might like, if a user likes a certain place such as a city we show places in that city that they may like or dislike at this stage when the user likes a place it will be saved/stored for them which they can then access.

we also have a bookmark feature that will allow users to bookmark certain city so if they wanted to jump back and search for places in that city again they can feel free to do so.

we also have a subscription page which will allow users to choose the plan they want, each plan have their very own unique perks.

starting from the basic daruma plan (basic)

- Ability to bookmark (limited to 5)

Salmans part:   
find 5-10 attractions in:
    1-syndey
    2-lebanon
    3-cambodia
    4-tokyo


Q1- What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

    In this project, we will be aiming at travellers who are being introduced to new countries/cities and they dont know the attraction sites or best places to eat (because come on, who doesn't love a good feed?). we will also be helping out couples who are looking for date ideas, or individuals planning family trips. in addittion to helping out businesses who are looking forward to expand their profit margin by having them included in our app for people to visit.

Q2- Identify the problem youâ€™re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

    This app will be aiming at people who are bored and tired of searching up new places to visit by limiting their searches to one screen. it will assist them in exploting new restaurants to eat, or find new adventures and experiences that they havn't had before! This problem needs solving because most of the future generations end up canceling their outings due to them not being able to plan or their lack of ability in searching places which end up causing a mental impact on them.
