**GMIT (Give me ideas to travel)**

The purpose of GMIT is to allow people to find places to travel when they don't know where to visit on their next trip. 

why we choose a daruma doll as our icon, the daruma doll is a symbol of happiness that people tend to buy so they can have their wish fulfilled we want users / clients to find a place they would like to visit to be happy or have their wish fulfilled.

the functionality of GMIT is a very simple and easy concept to understand clients / users can either like or dislike the places we show them, if a user dislikes a place we simply just show another place or city we think they might like, if a user likes a certain place such as a city we show places in that city that they may like or dislike at this stage when the user likes a place it will be saved/stored for them which they can then access.

we also have a bookmark feature that will allow users to bookmark certain city so if they wanted to jump back and search for places in that city again they can feel free to do so.

we also have a subscription page which will allow users to choose the plan they want, each plan have their very own unique perks.
